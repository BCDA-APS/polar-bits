def plot_data(x, y, z, i0=None, scatter=False, **kwargs):
    """Plot a scalar field ``z(x, y)`` from a flyscan as scatter or contour.

    Drops the first sample and, if needed, the last ``z`` value so the
    three arrays align. Optionally normalizes by an incident-intensity
    monitor ``i0``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Per-image x and y positions, typically the means returned by
        :func:`process_position_stream`.
    z : array_like
        Per-image scalar values (e.g. ROI sum from :func:`process_images`).
        May be one shorter than ``x``/``y`` when image triggers and
        position samples differ by one; in that case it is used as-is.
    i0 : array_like or None, optional
        Per-image incident intensity. When provided, ``z`` is divided by
        ``i0`` element-wise before plotting.
    scatter : bool, optional
        If True, use ``plt.scatter`` with one marker per point. If False
        (default), use ``plt.tricontourf`` for a filled contour plot.
    **kwargs
        Forwarded to the underlying matplotlib call.
